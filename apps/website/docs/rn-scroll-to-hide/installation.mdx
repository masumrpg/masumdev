  "react-native-reanimated": "^3.16.1"
}
```

  return {
    presets: ['babel-preset-expo'],
    plugins: ['react-native-reanimated/plugin'],
  };
};

- If you encounter "Reanimated plugin not found" error, verify your babel.config.js is properly configured
- Metro bundler cache issues can be resolved by clearing the cache: `npx react-native start --reset-cache`
- If animations are not working, check that Reanimated is properly configured in your babel.config.js
