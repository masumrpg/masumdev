# Basic Setup

:::tip
Place the `Toaster` at the root of your app to ensure all components have access to the toast functionality. This is crucial for proper state management and performance optimization.
:::

1. Add `Toaster` your app:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { View } from 'react-native';
import { Toaster } from '@masumdev/rn-toast';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <Toaster />
      {/* Your app content */}
    </View>
  );
}
```

2. Use the `useToast` hook in your components:

:::danger
Never call `useToast` outside of a React component or in a conditional statement. This will lead to unexpected behavior and potential memory leaks.
:::

:::tip
The `useToast` hook provides methods to show different types of toasts (success, error, info, warning). Choose the appropriate type based on your notification needs.
:::

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Button, View } from 'react-native';
import { useToast } from '@masumdev/rn-toast';

export default function MyComponent() {
  const { showToast } = useToast();

  const handlePress = () => {
    showToast('Operation successful!', 'success');
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Button title="Show Toast" onPress={handlePress} />
    </View>
  );
}
```
