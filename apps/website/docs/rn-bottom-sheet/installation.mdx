# Installation

## Prerequisites

:::danger Peer Dependencies
Make sure you have these peer dependencies installed in your React Native or Expo project. Using incompatible versions may cause unexpected behavior or crashes:

```json
{
  "react": "^18.3.1",
  "react-native": "^0.76.7",
  "react-native-reanimated": "^3.16.7",
  "react-native-gesture-handler": "^2.20.2",
  "react-native-safe-area-context": "^4.12.0"
}
```

### Installing prerequisites package

:::tip Recommended Installation
Use the following command to install all required peer dependencies at once:

```bash
npm install react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler react-native-safe-area-context
```
:::

## Expo Setup

:::tip Expo Installation
If you're using Expo, we recommend using `expo install` instead of `npm install` to ensure compatibility with your Expo SDK version.
:::

### Managed Workflow

1. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npx expo install react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler react-native-safe-area-context
```

2. Update your `babel.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = function (api) {
  api.cache(true);
  return {
    presets: ['babel-preset-expo'],
    plugins: ['react-native-reanimated/plugin'],
  };
};
```

3. Add the following to your `app.json` or `app.config.js`:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      "react-native-reanimated"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

:::danger Common Issues
- For Reanimated issues, ensure you've rebuilt the app after installing the package
- Make sure all peer dependencies versions match the requirements
- If you encounter "Reanimated plugin not found" error, verify your babel.config.js is properly configured
- Metro bundler cache issues can be resolved by clearing the cache: `npx react-native start --reset-cache`
